# Embedded_C_8051

hey there..
here i have uploaded my projects on 8051 microcontroller using embedded c programming
for these projects, i have used programming and simulation software
keil uVision 5 for c compiler 
proteus v.8 for simulation 
Each projects were properly designed in proteus and programmed using keil we can upload program to the virtual microcontroller in proteus.
Then we can run the simulation.

Before getting into the programming, you must have to study about the respective microcontroller.
