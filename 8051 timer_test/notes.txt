TMOD represents which timer u r gonna use and in which mode u r gonna use that timer 
by means of hexa code starts with 0x next two digit represents the hexa value and compare it with TMOD SFR table

then u will get an clear idea about TMOD....

8051 Micro Controller Delay generation process

1.      Load the TMOD value register indicating which timer (timer 0 or timer 1) is to be used and which timer mode (0 or 1) is selected.
2.      Load registers TL and TH with initial count value.
3.      Start the timer.
4.      Keep monitoring the timer flag (TF). if it is raised,
5.      ÉStop the timer.
6.      Clear the TF flag for the next round
7.      Go back to Step 2 to load TH and TL again.

How to calculate values to be loaded into TH and TL 

Assume XTAL = 11.0592 MHz, we can use the following steps for finding the TH and TL registersí values,
1.      Divide the desired time delay by 1.085 us.
2.      Calculate 65536 ñ n, where n is the decimal value we got in Step1.
3.      Convert the result of Step2 to hex, where yyxx is the initial hex value to be loaded into the timerís register
4.      Set TL = xx and TH = yy.


thank u..
fuck u...

for 1ms TH0 = FC; TL0 = 66;
